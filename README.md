# BikeBrain Raspberry Pi Pico code

This is the code for the device section of the project *BikeBrain* (click [here](https://github.com/GustavoAdamee/BikeBrainApp) to see the code for the app section)

## About the project

*BikeBrain* is a project that aims to offer cyclists a monitoring and security device to their bikes. It works as a cyclecomputer that supplies the user with training metrics through a screen and logs their performance in a mobile app synchronized with the device. It also counts with an alarm and GPS tracking system, sending updates on the bike's status to the user's phone.

This project was developed for the Integration Workshop 2 course, Computer Engineering â€” UTFPR.
